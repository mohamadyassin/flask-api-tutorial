# REST APIs with Flask

## Udemy MOOC

I have been wanting to learn APIs for a couple of years, but I haven't gotten a chance to take a deeper dive until a couple of weeks ago. I was on a break from classes for my GIS certificate. So, I decided to take a Udemy class [REST APIs with Flask and Python
]( https://www.udemy.com/course/rest-api-flask-and-python). It had excellent reviews and I wasn’t disappointed. Actually, it was quite the contrary. The instructor is a great guy. He took his time to thoroughly explain everything. I learned so much by taking this class. The end result was this repository (minus a couple of functionalities that I had to compromise due to deployment issues -which I did not need anyway). 

The whole tutorial was written in Python and deployed in a docker image. I used [render]( https://render.com/) for free web service host which easily connects to GitHub. I also used both render and [ElephantSQL]( https://www.elephantsql.com/) to deploy a PostgreSQL database for development and production.

## Swagger

The best way to visualize the application I created in this class is by using [Swagger]( https://swagger.io/). You can test the app and read the documentation by clicking on this link: [Flask-API-Python-Project]( https://rest-apis-flask-python-project-k33k.onrender.com/swagger-ui). Please be patient if it doesn’t respond immediately. It is a free service after all. It may take a minute to restart after being dormant.

## What’s next?

I was enticed to create an app for my GIS class or other data science projects. But I had to hold my horses. First, I will take another course. There are two other major framework for web development: [Django]( https://www.djangoproject.com/) and [FastAPI]( https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/). FastAPI has become very popular over the past two years. So, I think that I will learn the ins-and-outs of FastAPI before starting to create my own apps. I found a great course on [freeCodeCamp]( https://youtu.be/0sOvCWFmrtA) which has additional frameworks and tools.
